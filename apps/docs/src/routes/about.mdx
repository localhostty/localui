# About LocalUI

LocalUI is a Project at creating a rich and accessible Primitive UI Library for SolidJS that is inspired from BaseUI. The goal is to have a equivalent to BaseUI in SolidJS that can be built on top of to create Components similar to shadcn. While it is going to take a while until we are there, we will be there at some point. I'm currently just working alone on this Project so expect the progress to be slow, since I still learn a lot.

## Primitives

Given we are based on BaseUI, we plan on designing our API and list of Primitives equal to BaseUI. Given that, here are all the primitives we intend to implement:

- [ ] Avatar
- [ ] Button (WIP)
- [ ] Checkbox
- [ ] Collapsible (WIP)
- [ ] Dialog
- [ ] Input
- [ ] Meter
- [ ] Popover
- [ ] Progress
- [ ] Radio
- [ ] Scroll Area
- [ ] Separator
- [ ] Slider
- [ ] Switch
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Toast
- [ ] Accordion
- [ ] Alert Dialog
- [ ] Autocomplete
- [ ] Checkbox Group
- [ ] Combobox
- [ ] Context Menu
- [ ] Field
- [ ] Fieldset
- [ ] Form
- [ ] Menu
- [ ] Menubar
- [ ] Navigation Menu
- [ ] Number Field
- [ ] Preview Card
- [ ] Select
- [ ] Toggle
- [ ] Toggle Group
- [ ] Toolbar
- [ ] Tooltip

This list will be regularly updated, depending on the Progress, expect things to go faster in the future. I'm currently still figuring out and learning about primitives, so I'm handwriting pretty much all the code.
